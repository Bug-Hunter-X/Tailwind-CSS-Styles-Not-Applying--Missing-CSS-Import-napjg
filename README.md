# Tailwind CSS Styles Not Applying: Missing CSS Import

This repository demonstrates a common error when using Tailwind CSS: forgetting to import the generated CSS file into your project.

## The Problem

Even if you're using Tailwind directives correctly in your components, if the CSS file isn't imported, no styles will be applied. This can be very frustrating to debug, as the error message is often non-existent.

## The Solution

The solution is straightforward: ensure that the generated Tailwind CSS file (typically `output.css`) is correctly imported into your main application or component file.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Notice that the `bug.js` file uses Tailwind classes but doesn't import Tailwind's CSS.
3. Run the application (instructions in `bug.js`)
4. Observe that no Tailwind styles are applied. 
5. Refer to `bugSolution.js` for the fix.
